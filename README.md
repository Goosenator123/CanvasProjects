## Key Features:

- Examples of basic shapes and drawing techniques
- Interactive projects demonstrating animation and user interactions
- Demonstrations of canvas transformations and effects
- Experimentation with gradients, patterns, and image manipulation
- Clear and organized code structure for easy exploration and learning

## Usage:

Feel free to explore, fork, or clone this repository to kickstart your journey into HTML Canvas. Each section is well-documented and labeled, making it a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced developers seeking to improve their skills in web graphics and interactive design.

## Projects:

### [BasicDrawing](./BasicDrawing/)

BasicDrawing provides fundamental code examples for drawing shapes and elements on an HTML5 canvas.

### [BouncingCircles](./BouncingCircles/)

BouncingCircles is a simple canvas project featuring colorful circles bouncing around the window's edges against a black background.

### [InteractiveBouncingCircles](./InteractiveBouncingCircles/)

InteractiveBouncingCircles is a dynamic web page featuring bouncing circles that respond to user cursor movements. The circles grow in size as the user moves the cursor closer, creating an interactive visual experience.

### [GravityCircles](./GravityCircles/)

GravityCircles presents an immersive canvas experience showcasing balls cascading and rebounding across the screen upon contact with the canvas's bottom edge. The simulation resets upon user click or screen resize to ensure smooth animation and prevent any visual clipping.

### [StaticCollision](./StaticCollision/)

StaticCollision displays several unmoving circles on a black canvas without any overlap. A smaller circle tracks the user's mouse, changing color when it touches any of the static circles.

### [CircularMotion](./CircularMotion/)

CircularMotion features dynamically drawn lines that orbit around the user's cursor, creating an engaging circular motion effect. The lines gracefully follow the cursor's movement, enhancing the interactive experience.
